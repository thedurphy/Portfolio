In each area, the participant ranks from 1(highest) to 10(lowest) in what they determine as important.  Since these are Mentor/Mentee Pairs, **Personal** development takes slight precedence, however, we can still derive important attributes from the **Market** development rankings in combination with the third area, **OFFER** (what they an offer to someone else's development), that actually contribute to **Personal** development.

As I mentioned earlier, this section will be used with the **OFFER** section. Here is how.  The **Market** development rankings tell us what the participant deems important to the market as a whole.  If what they deem as important to the *Market* is not found in what they can *Offer*, we can imply that what is not included in the *Offer* area is an area they can improve upon and will take seriously in making improvements since they deem it important to the Market.  We will take into consideration **only** the areas that are not in the **OFFER** when creating the final **ASK** multiplier.  Now a little about the **OFFER** section.\n",

    "The areas we will be looking at for determining the **OFFER** of a participant will be the `ASK_Market` and `OFFER` sheets.  Previously, we have determined the inverse point values in the `ASK_Market` area.  I also mentioned that there is an additional way to have an area considered in the `OFFER` area.  Each area, lettered `A-J` above, have their respective sheets that allow  participants to name other participants who they deem are proficient in a certain area.  Each mention will be worth 0.2 points which will be added to the `OFFER` section.  Within the `OFFER` section, each self-proclaimed proficiency is worth 1.0 point.  The reason for the different weights were a suggestion based on the fact that if the participant declares their own proficiency in an area, they are more willing to offer better input for others that need to develop that area.  We will take the accumulated points in the `OFFER` section, between what the participants think they are proficient in and what others have endorsed, and then add then to the the inverse points accumulated in the `ASK_Market` section.  The reason being is that the `ASK_Market` section is a representation of what the participant things will help develop the market in general.  This joined with what they think can offer plus what others thing they offer is the overall **Offer Rating**.\n",

    "The **Synergy Score** can be defined in general terms as the degree at which a participant's (A) **Explicit** *and* **Implicit** needs are satisfied by another participant (B).  Simply put, how much does person B offer to person A with respect to person A's needs.  \n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "1. **Synergy Score** is a directional score, meaning, the score does not have to be symmetrical.  In fact, in meaning, it is never the same.  It is always how much participant B is offering participant A and cannot be reversed in meaning. $Synergy(A,B) \\neq Synergy(B,A)$ is possible.\n",
    "2. The score, in this case, is also dependent on how others view a particular participant.  We've weighted those inputs $1/5$ of how a participant views themselves.  I must note that one could easily justify a different weight depending on the situation."
